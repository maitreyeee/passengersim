    """Define a booking curve.
    
    For a given customer type, the booking curve gives the cumulative fraction 
    of those customers who are expected to have already "arrived" at any given
    data collection point (DCP).  An "arriving" customer is one who is interested
    in booking, but may or may not actually purchase a travel product from one
    of the carriers, depending on the availability of products at the time of their
    arrival.
    
    The values (cumulative fraction of customers arriving) should increase 
    monotonically as the keys (DCPs, e.g. days to departure) decrease.
