    Compute average bid price history over all legs for each carrier.

    This query requires that the simulation was run while recording leg
    details (i.e. with the `leg` flag set on `Config.db.write_items`),
    including bid prices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cnx : Database
    scenario : str
    burn_samples : int, default 100
        The bid prices will be analyzed ignoring this many samples from the
        beginning of each trial.
    weighting : {'equal', 'capacity'}, default 'equal'
        How to weight the bid prices.  If 'equal', then each leg is weighted
        equally.  If 'capacity', then each leg is weighted by its total capacity.

        The resulting dataframe is indexed by `carrier` and `days_prior`, and has

        - `bid_price_mean`: Average bid price across all samples and all legs

        - `fraction_some_cap`: Fraction of all legs across all samples that have
            non-zero capacity available for sale.
        - `fraction_zero_cap`: Fraction of all legs across all samples that have
            zero capacity available for sale.  Bid prices are computed for these
            legs but are not really meaningful.
        - `some_cap_bid_price_mean`: Average bid price across all samples and
            all legs conditional on the leg having non-zero capacity.
